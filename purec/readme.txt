You'll need the following files from the parent folder
to build the library with Pure C:

REGEXP.H
regerror.c
regexp.c
regsub.c

Put them in the same folder as the project file:
V8REGEXP.PRJ

The following will be produced:
V8REGEXP.LIB

Put the library file in PURE_C\LIB
Put the header in PURE_C\INCLUDE

(or wherever you have Pure C installed)
